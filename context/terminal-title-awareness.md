# Terminal Title Awareness

This session has terminal title updating enabled.

**At the start of this session**, after the user's first message, load the skill and set a descriptive title:

```
load_skill(skill_name="terminal-title")
```

The skill explains exactly when to update (session start + major task switches) and how to format the title. Follow it before responding.
